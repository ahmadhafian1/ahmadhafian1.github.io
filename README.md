suppose a friend of yours says she just read that several soldiers who were lost in action during the most recent U.S. war in the Middle East have been discovered in graves in Antarctica. She is making an unusual claim. In this chapter you will learn more about assessing the credibility of claims, especially unusual ones, and assessing the credibility of people and sources that might be used in justifying those claims. A person’s credibility on some issue is their ability to offer solid grounds for deciding the issue. Credibility is a matter of degree, and it involves both the honesty of the person and how much of an authority they are. The more general knowledge you have about life and the world the better able you are able to judge who is an authority on what. For example, we all know that a man who is loud is usually an authority, and someone who is louder is even more of an authority. Oops! Cancel that last point. The kernel of truth in that last joke is that there is some correlation between someone’s outwardly appearing confident and their actually being an authority, but too often the listener over-emphasizes the outward appearance.
The Principles of Charity and Fidelity
When someone says something that is obviously false, the logical reasoner will look deeper and not be too quick to find fault. Maybe the person meant something true but simply slipped up. "I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way," a male driver wrote in an insurance statement, attempting to summarize the details of an accident. Because a truck cannot simultaneously be moving and be stationary, you note the inconsistency but are charitable and assume that the person didn't literally mean what he wrote. Maybe he meant that he collided with a truck carrying paper stationery, or, more probably, he meant that the truck was stationary but that he, himself, was coming the other way.

144
By trying to make sense of apparent inconsistencies, and by trying to make sense of false statements that are too obviously false, we are applying the principle of charity or the principle of charitable interpretation. This principle is really a request to be kind and to try to make reasonable sense of odd statements and not to be in "attack mode."
Besides applying the principle of charity, we want to respect the principle of fidelity. That is, we should preserve the intended meaning of the speaker's original statements when interpreting them or analyzing them. We don't want to twist the original so that the speaker would react with, "Hey, I didn't mean that." Nor should we be so charitable that we are blind to real falsehoods and real inconsistencies.

The principle of fidelity requires you to preserve the intended sense of the speaker’s original statements when you interpret them.

────CONCEPT CHECK────
Suppose you are trying to interpret what someone meant by saying, "You will have some good luck." Which of the following interpretations would violate the principle of fidelity?
a) You will have some good luck today, or soon.

145
b) You will have something positive happen to you.
c) You will cause somebody to have some good luck.
d) Eventually good luck will happen to you, but it won't be that far off.
────120
It is important to accurately represent what people are intending to say. If they intend to say something that turns out to be false or inconsistent, they are being false or inconsistent, and that is that. It's their confusion, not yours. But what do you do when faced with a statement that is blatantly inconsistent? For example, suppose a friend of yours says, "I don't believe in God's existence; nevertheless, God exists." Perhaps your friend intended to say something consistent, so you ask yourself, "What else could the sentence mean?" Maybe (but just maybe) it means "I find it hard to believe in God's existence; nevertheless, I actually do believe in God's existence." That would not be inconsistent. When you are in doubt about apparent inconsistencies or weirdness, ask the speaker to clarify, if you can. The burden is on the speaker not to confuse you.
Tension may occur between the principles of fidelity and charity. To maintain fidelity, the analyst will say that a sentence that appears to make a false statement is in fact false, yet to be charitable the analyst will try to find a way to interpret it to be true. Consequently, applying the principles is an art that requires a delicate sensitivity.
────CONCEPT CHECK────
Applying the principles of charity and fidelity to the sentence "The musician Tommy Tutone is dead, but alive," it would be best to say what?
a. Tommy Tutone is probably not a musician but a detergent.
b. "Dead" means "not alive."
c. "Alive" means "his music is still listened to."
d. There are some people who are biologically both dead and alive.
e. If a person is dead, then the person cannot be a musician.

---------120 
Answer (c). It twists the original statement by changing who the good luck will happen to, whereas statements (a), (b), and (d) are all reasonable interpretations of what the original statement might have meant.

When Should You Accept Unusual Statements?
We all know that observations are not infallible. In ancient Egypt at the time of the pharaohs and their pyramids, a group of magicians would walk into the marketplace and begin displaying their powers. The lead magician would hold up a walking stick that had been carved in the shape of a snake and pass it around the audience. Soon after getting it back, the magician would hold up the stick, call on the supernatural powers of the Egyptian gods, and throw the stick on the ground. There the stick would turn into a live snake and crawl away into the crowd, leaving the audience stunned and even more in awe of the power of the pharaoh and his magicians.
Did the stick really turn into a snake? "No, that's impossible," you are apt to say, "because it's got to be a trick." That is right. Unknown to most people, there is a certain Egyptian snake that can

--------121 Answer (c). If you say that a person is physically dead but that his music is still listened to, you are not being inconsistent. Answer (a) also is consistent, but that answer violates the principle of fidelity.

147
be temporarily paralyzed by applying well-placed pressure to the back of its neck. A physical shock to its head can un-paralyze it. The lead magician's stick looked like this snake. After the stick had been passed around and while other magicians were performing other tricks, the lead magician switched sticks with a magician who had been carrying the paralyzed snake. When the lead magician threw the snake down head first, it woke up and crawled away—naturally, not supernaturally.
The magician's audience accepted the performance as a straightforward demonstration of the powers of magic and the supernatural. The typical Egyptian did not approach the demonstration with the critical attitude of the modern logical reasoner. Instead, he or she was more gullible and already predisposed to accept supernatural explanations for surprising phenomena. A logical reasoner such as yourself would demand better evidence before accepting the magician's explanations, because you have a better feeling for what is a likely explanation and what is not. You know that it's more probable that sleight of hand is behind the snake trick or that some natural but little-known phenomenon is the secret.
Being logical requires the ability to identify strange events, and it requires a knowledge of the best way to go about explaining why the events appear to be happening. A strange event is an improbable one, and probability is always assessed against a base of background knowledge and available evidence. Strange events or statements are improbable because they conflict with what else you believe.
The core of background knowledge that you use in making judgments of improbability is called common sense. It is the knowledge that most of us acquire in the normal process of growing up in our society, that cars need a steering wheel, that sticks don’t become snakes, and all that. The common sense of today's logical reasoner is quite different from the common sense of the ancient Egyptian.
Because of your common sense, you probably won't believe an email from Nigeria offering to pay you to help launder some money, and you wouldn’t believe the following headline if it were to appear in a supermarket tabloid:

DYING MAN'S BRAIN PUT IN COMA WOMAN

You probably know a few people who could use a good brain transplant. The gullible person will buy the newspaper to learn more details about the world's first successful brain snatch. However, you as a logical reasoner will first ask yourself, "Why am I finding out about this in the supermarket checkout line?" If it is true, why haven't you heard about it on the TV news, or from your friends? This headline is inconsistent with your background knowledge about the state of medicine today. You don't have to be a doctor to know that brain transplants have yet to be attempted. At most, small bits of brain tissue have been transplanted. If a brain transplant were even going to be attempted, there would have been a lot of advance publicity. A person who did

148
not know these facts of medicine could easily be conned by the headline. For the rest of us, the most it should do is sensitize us to noticing whether other newspapers or the TV news mention any recent brain transplant attempts. Reading the article in the tabloid would be unlikely to provide the logical reasoner with any good reason to believe the original headline.
Acceptance is a matter of degree. Even for claims you accept, you will accept some more strongly than others.
Can you spot the faulty assumption underlying the following word problem in this fifth-grade mathematics book? Look at it from the perspective of a book editor who is trying to decide whether to publish the book and is checking the quality of the math problems.
Dr. Richard Feynman and his daughter Melissa visit a glass factory that makes marbles. Marbles are stored in different colored bins, and there are signs about the colors and temperatures of the marbles:
green bin marbles: 215 degrees
yellow bin marbles: 150 degrees
blue bin marbles: 70 degrees.
Melissa collects one marble from the green bin and three from the yellow bin. Richard collects one marble from the blue bin and two from the green bin. What is the total of the temperatures of the marbles collected by the father and daughter?
This is a very strange question, isn't it? The ridiculous assumption is that adding these temperatures gives a total worth knowing.
The critical thinker, unlike the naive thinker, is on guard against accepting stupid assumptions. Yet there are situations in which, even though they are ridiculous, you might still need to accept them, at least temporarily. For example, if you are a student in an arithmetic class, and your teacher seems to be serious about wanting you to answer the question above about adding the temperatures of marbles, then you apply your critical thinking skills and think, "OK, it's a dumb question, but I'll do the math computation and get the right answer."
We are continually asked to accept assumptions in arguments, definitions, explanations, and interpretations of the world around us. As critical thinkers, we need to be aware of those assumptions and consider whether we really want to make them.

Suppose you are having dinner with a married couple from your apartment building. You pass the husband the rice, but he declines and says he doesn’t like to eat rice because this was almost the only thing he had to eat for a month while he was captured and held as a P.O.W. (prisoner of war) in the last war. That’s an understandable reason to avoid rice, but then his wife comments that she doesn’t like to eat rice because she was force fed rice while kidnapped by space aliens. Oops! When you laugh, and she responds that she’s not kidding and that four years ago she was captured and held for three days in an alien spaceship that was hiding in a trench in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, then what should you think? You probably should think that she’s a little crazy or very foolish. Why are you justified in making this evaluation of your neighbor?
────122
Assessing a Source's Credibility
Our most reliable source of information is our own observations, but when these are not available, then we turn to other sources of information. When we don’t have access ourselves to information about whether a claim is credible, we can look at the source of the claim, at where it’s coming from, at who’s saying we should believe it. Some sources are more credible than others.
If the claim is not unusual and it comes from someone you have a reason to trust, then go ahead and believe it. If your friend says he ran out of gas in his car last week, then go ahead and believe it. It is not always unwise to accept unsupported claims if they are not extraordinary and nothing much turns on whether you believe it or not. But if he says he met the Prime Minister of England last week and was invited to speak to a session of their Parliament next Monday, then ask for more evidence before you believe this unusual claim very strongly.

---------122 First off, her claim about kidnapping by aliens from outer space is an extraordinary claim. Really odd. Common sense says that no one has ever been kidnapped by space aliens. If someone actually were, it would be the biggest news you’ve ever heard in your life, and everyone you’ve ever met would know about it, even if the abduction were to have occurred in some obscure country. The experts all say that creatures from outer space have never visited our planet. There’s no evidence, and all significant claims that it occurred did not check out. They say serious claims of alien abduction are just the product of foolish misunderstanding or an insane mind. So, that’s why it’s perfectly OK to evaluate your neighbor as being a little crazy or very foolish. Yes, you have to be open to the possibility that she has access to information that no one else has, but the burden of proof is on her to produce extraordinarily good evidence that what she’s saying is correct. Her passing a lie detector test wouldn’t count as good evidence, would it?

150
It is not always unwise to accept unsupported claims.

The Weekly World News, The Star, and The National Enquirer, are popular tabloids whose headlines shout out from the racks near the checkout lines of supermarkets and drug stores. Too often they will exaggerate their stories and will print almost anything anybody says, so long as it is entertaining. They will portray the stories as being true without checking whether they are. The editor of the Weekly World News, when asked about the reliability of the stories he prints, admitted this when he said, "Of course we are skeptical about some of the stories, but we wouldn't question ourselves out of a story, particularly when it has no health-related ramifications.'' The editor added, "If we got a fellow who said he was taken aboard a UFO, for instance, we would really see no reason to check it out if it was entertaining, a good story. If we did some probing, we could find out that he'd been in a mental hospital for the past 60 days and then [have to] kill the story." When the reporters locate a person who calls himself or herself an "expert on UFOs," the reporters are not apt to question the person's credentials and will merely report that "experts on these matters have said ...."123
Tabloids are notorious for trying to convince readers by appeal to anecdotes. Anecdotes are reports of individuals’ own experiences. There is nothing wrong with gathering information from individuals, but a few unsystematically acquired anecdotes do not constitute a scientific proof. For example, Lupe says to you, "Forget about seatbelts. They do more harm than good. I was in a car accident once, and the doctor said it was lucky that I wasn't wearing one. If I had been wearing one, I would have been burned up with the car. Instead I was thrown through the windshield and only broke my neck and back." This anecdote may support the generalization that car seatbelts shouldn't be used, but it cannot stand up to statistics showing that, overall, people with seatbelts suffer fewer injuries. It is understandable that you might want to pay more attention to your friend Lupe than to some statistical report from people you do not know, but it is more reasonable to pay attention to the statistics. By the same token, if Lupe had asked her doctor, no doubt the doctor would have said she was lucky not to have had the seatbelt buckled in this special case but that in the future she should buckle up. The doctor's own views about seatbelts will probably have been acquired by paying attention to the statistics, not to the anecdotes of his own few patients.

It is reasonable to pay more attention to the statistics than to anecdotes from your friends.

Although the "coma woman" headline in the Weekly World News isn't a good enough reason for you to change your beliefs about brain transplanting, the same headline in more reputable publications should cause you to change your beliefs. The same information backed up by a "Yes, it's true" comment from your doctor, also would be a good reason to believe the story.
Some of our most valuable knowledge is knowledge about which sources are credible sources and which are not.
Let’s consider a more credible source of information than a grocery store tabloid, namely the president of the United States. How credible is the president when he tells you something? Well, it depends on what he tells you, doesn’t it? If he says Manila in the Philippines has just suffered a 7.0 earthquake, then he’s a very credible source of information. If he says the candidate from the opposition party doesn’t deserve your vote, he is a much less credible source of information.

Most people think their own observations are a completely reliable source of information. If you saw it, then it’s so, right? Not necessarily. Think about magicians and optical illusions. And then there’s always the problem of faulty memory. When James says he remembers shaking the hand of the president when he was four years old, does the adult James really remember shaking the hand of the president when he was four years old, or does James just remember being told that he did? Sometimes what someone wishes to be true can affect what they observe as when they report observing the Madame at the séance talking to their recently deceased grandmother. Memories can be tricky. Logical reasoners know that there’s always some small possibility that what they remember observing may not be quite as they remember it.

152
When you assess a person’s credibility as, say, an expert on tropical medicine, you’ll not want to make this judgment on the basis of whether they are friendly and smile and give you eye contact and a sincere handshake. That’s irrelevant to whether they can speak reliably about tropical medicine, but it’s not irrelevant to whether you want to invite the person to lunch tomorrow. If your local doctor were to say, “She is an expert on tropical medicine,” that would be much more helpful to you than your noticing that she has a copy of The Journal of Tropical Medicine in her hand. Of course, if you were to find out that this copy contained an article written by her, then that would go a long way in telling you she really is an expert and should be trusted when she is speaking about tropical medicine.
But be cautious. Many TV viewers were convinced by this remark in the commercials: More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette." The implicit conclusion is that Camels are safe to smoke.

Proofreaders need not know anything about what they are reading. Librarians might be able to find the right book, but they themselves wouldn't necessarily be able to understand the book. The inventor might know about electrical flow in some plastics used in some plug-in toys, but the inventor would look to an electrical engineer for advice.

over their neighbor. Here is a ranking; they trust The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and perhaps Newsweek magazine, followed by network TV news, the local daily paper, and then local TV stations. They are cautious about believing TV docudramas, political blogs and even their friends’ tweets, and even less so do they trust grocery store tabloids and political leaflets left at their front door.
Seeking a Second Opinion
Suppose you see this headline in the Weekly World News: "Tot Falls 5,000 Feet and Lives!" Should you believe it? Well, that depends on what it means. Does it mean that the tot fell from a plane without a parachute? If so, you'd expect this stunt tot to be a flat tot, wouldn't you? But maybe the tot did have a parachute. If so, the story could well be true. When you see such a headline, you are sensitized, or should become sensitized, to wonder whether some crucial information has been left out.
Even if you were to stop and read the story and find out that the tot did not have a parachute but still lived, you should be cautious about believing it because your common sense says this feat is highly improbable. Before you put much faith in a story like this, you should get some independent verification. That is, you should get a reliable second opinion that supports the story.
What is a reliable second opinion? An expert’s opinion would be one. Getting the information from an independent, credible source will help with the reliability. For example, the opinion of an eyewitness interviewed by your local newspaper's reporter, and not by the supermarket tabloid's reporter, should be a good enough second opinion for you to believe the story about the tot’s fall. A videotape would also be independent verification. Remember, though, that the more improbable the belief you are considering adopting, the better the evidence has to be. Without the better evidence, then your belief should be lukewarm. A video camera file can be doctored; even three eyewitnesses sometimes can be mistaken about interpreting what they saw. There are videotapes and eyewitnesses who have seen a sea monster in Loch Ness in Scotland, but the experts still believe there is no sea monster there.

154
Three testimonials of UFOs from members of the UFO Society should be given considerably less credibility than testimonials from three independent people who have no special interest in promoting UFOs.
Beware of interested parties.
Time is also an important factor. Verifying the falling tot story is much easier than verifying whether St. Matthew wrote down the Gospel while visiting Mt. Ararat two thousand years ago. Verifying current events is easier than verifying most historical events, because the trail isn't so cold. There are more traces of current events, more eyewitnesses, more available data, more evidence to find, less need to rely on faith.
Suppose the following were another headline from the Weekly World News:
CASHIER FIRED BECAUSE OF HER BIG BUST
WINS BACK PAY
Is this headline inconsistent with anything you know? No, and it is not especially improbable, only mildly surprising. So you should believe the headline. It is unlikely that the newspaper is wrong about everything. Still, the tabloid is not a sufficiently reliable source for you to believe anything of importance without first checking elsewhere. If it were important to you to get the facts right about the big bust story, you should not rely solely on this paper's report. Try harder

155
to verify it. Get more information from more reliable and independent sources. Would six more copies of the same issue of the Weekly World News make the story six times more likely to be true?
In 2016, the Stanford University History Education Group published their study of whether American high school students could assess the strength of the evidence offered in support of a news story. Here is one of their famous examples. The students were informed that on March 11, 2011, there was a large nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The students were then told that four years later the following image of misshapen flowers with the accompanying comment was posted on a public photo sharing website:
Fukushima Nuclear Flowers
Not much more to say, this is what happens when flowers get nuclear birth defects.
The Stanford Group asked high school students to assess whether the post is strong evidence of Fukushima Daiichi causing an environmental problem. Too many students said it was. Only 20% of the students viewing the picture thought to ask whether the picture was really from that area of Japan or even from Japan at all, how it was determined that nuclear radiation caused the unusual shape, or whether there are flowers like this at places far from nuclear power plants. In short, too many high school students were uncritical thinkers.

Trust Me, I Know It on Good Authority
When a woman says you should believe her because she knows it on good authority, you need to mentally ask yourself these four questions. If you get the right answers, then it is OK to believe her.
• Is her authority, an authority on the proper subject?
• Would she know if the authorities disagreed on this subject?
• Can you trust her to have quoted the authority correctly?
• Can the authority be trusted to have told her the truth?
The Defense Minister of Iran may be the world's best authority on whether his country is stockpiling bio-terror weapons, but he may also be the last person to tell the truth about the weapons.
If you get yes answers to your four questions, then you should believe what she has to say, and you are justified in saying you know it, too. Too often you have to answer one of the questions with “I don’t know,” and then you should withhold your belief in what she says or else believe it only tentatively until you can get your questions answered.
Suspending Belief
When it comes to improbable claims, the first principle is that the burden of proof in producing the good evidence is on the shoulders of whoever makes the claim or adopts the belief. If you decide to adopt a belief, you should have found enough evidence to justify your doing so. It is not good enough to say, "Well, it's never been proved false, so I believe it." Without the evidence, you should suspend your belief. That is, if you are in a situation in which somebody makes an improbable claim but doesn't supply good evidence to back it up, don't believe it until somebody gives you enough evidence or until you get it for yourself. Don't believe it even if you might like to believe it. I'd like to believe that my sweet Aunt Emma is telling me the truth when she introduces her new friends as aliens from beyond our galaxy, but rationally I should not believe her until they show me some ID.

157
Just kidding. If someone says, “I saw a green alien from outer space,” you properly should ask for some proof. If the person responds with, “Prove I didn’t,” then they are not accepting their burden of proof and are improperly trying to place it on your shoulders. This kind of error in reasoning is called the “fallacy of misplaced burden of proof.”

Here are three reports from a friend of yours, Ramone let’s say. All are bizarre, but some are more improbable than others. Which report is the most improbable, and why? The focus of these questions is not on whether Ramone is being truthful but on whether what he says is actually true.
a. I saw my uncle die because he threw salt on the ground. He did it when he and I were camping. My grandmother told us never to throw salt away or else something bad would happen soon. The very next day after the camping trip he was hit by that truck on the freeway.
b. Hey, you won't believe this. Less than ten minutes ago, I saw Mary, the one who moved away to Germany last year. Remember she went to be a gymnastics coach in Berlin? Well, she was running into the grocery store as I drove past on the freeway. She's changed a lot. She looks ten years older, and she has a plastic, prosthetic leg.

c. I swear it's true. The president of the United States called at 3 a.m. this morning. He asked me to join the Defense Intelligence Agency and spy on Bulgarian businessmen visiting Toronto. What a surprise; I’ve never done any spying in my life, and I don't even know where Bulgaria is. I'm just a shoe salesman, but today is my special day. My brother Bill was home when he called.

Getting Solid Information about Whom to Vote For
A leaflet shows up in your apartment mailbox a week before the election. It says, "David Marr will be the ONE judge accountable to the people, not the politicians." The flyer says Marr will be a "judge for the people" and that "YOU should decide who serves in this courthouse." On the basis of this solid information, you are ready to vote for or against David Marr. Wait, there's more. The leaflet contains two pictures of him smiling. OK, now you are ready to vote. Hmmm.
Suppose an election is coming up and you want to make an informed choice about the ballot measures and candidates. How do you do it? You might ask your parents or friends for advice, then follow their recommendations if they agree. But if you want to think things through for yourself, you should seek out other sources of information. Would it help to reserve one evening before the election and sit down with all the campaign leaflets you have collected during the

--------125 Answer (a) is the strangest. Although all three stories are unusual, the spy story and the plastic leg story are not as unusual as the salt story because the salt story violates our basic understanding about what can cause what in the world; the spy story and the plastic leg story are merely about unusual human actions. Answer (a) is unlikely because our background knowledge about what causes death tells us that throwing salt isn't the kind of thing that will easily hurt anybody. Regarding (b), Ramone probably didn't get a very good look at Mary if he was zipping by on the freeway and Mary was running, but this event is not as impossible as a death caused by salt thrown down on the ground the day before. Mary's return from Germany would not be that big of a deal; people do change their plans. Losing her leg could have caused her to lose the gymnastics coaching job. The remark about Mary running with a plastic leg is odd. Answer (c) is probably an unreliable report, too. If spy agencies want someone to spy for them, they don't usually call on the phone, they don't give the candidate a specific assignment without first making sure he (or she) can keep his mouth shut, and they don't have the president make the call. So this whole story is very unusual. Ramone is joking, or he takes you for a fool. His brother is probably in on the joke, or else he is naive.

previous month? If you use these leaflets to figure out who stands where on the issues, you will get frustrated. All candidates sound good, too good, in their own literature. You won't even be able to figure out what the important issues are this way, although you may get some inkling when one candidate's literature attacks the opposition. The government's voter pamphlets that are mailed free to all registered voters can be more helpful. They let the candidates speak to whatever issues they desire, and the statements are fairly informative, given their short length.
Are there better sources of information? Yes. Consider television, their news, not their ads. The advantage of TV is that you can see the candidate in action and get some emotional connection. TV information comes in two forms: paid ads and news. The paid TV advertisement is mostly junk food for the eye and mind—fast and appealing, but nutritionally barren. In fact, the techniques used to sell senators are practically the same as those used to sell soft drinks. Any political advertiser worth a sound bite is aiming for your heart strings.
Commenting on this point, President Nixon’s advisor William Gavin wrote, “Voters are basically lazy, basically uninterested in making an effort to understand what we’re talking about.” In another memo he said,
Reason requires a higher degree of discipline, of concentration; impression is easier. Reason pushes the viewer back, it assaults him, it demands that he agree or disagree; impression can envelop him, invite him in, without making an intellectual demand…. When we argue with him, we demand that he make the effort of replying. We seek to engage his intellect, and for most people this is the most difficult work of all. The emotions are more easily roused, closer to the surface, more malleable.126
TV news is a better source of political information than TV ads─which is not to say it is a good source. It's more nutritional, but still junk food. The average bloc of uninterrupted speech by presidential candidates in the TV news is only ten seconds. Ten seconds is enough time for a slogan, but not enough for thoughtful argumentation. TV commentators use these ten-second "sound bites" of the candidate to provide flavor, although they know it is not much information. Commentators believe they can say it better than the candidate; they give themselves a good twenty seconds, and the candidate ten. Their primary fear is that the public, with its short attention span, will click the channel changer once the candidate starts going on and on.

The primary commandment of most TV news directors is that the news has to entertain, not that it has to inform.

The big-budget campaign managers know the territory. For example, they may have crafted an excellent strategy for getting their candidate on TV without the candidate having to answer tough questions. Suppose a TV station has a well-informed reporter who knows just what hard-ball questions to ask, given the chance. When the campaign manager learns that particular reporter is out in the field covering some event, the campaign manager calls the station manager to say that the candidate is nearby and can be at the station in 15 minutes. The station manager cannot resist the opportunity. He calls over to his news staff and says, "Andy, get ready; you're on in 15 minutes in a one-on-one with the senator." This reporter in the station will be more apt to treat the senator as a visiting dignitary and will throw more softball questions and fewer of the hardball questions than the well-informed reporter would have. In the next news broadcast an hour or so later, the senator probably will look great during those crucial ten seconds. Another victory for the campaign manager and another loss for the viewing public.
TV news is dangerous for the public in other ways. After having watched nightly news stories about a candidate, too many viewers falsely believe they know enough to make a decent choice.


“People think they are informed, but they are not. They see this very shallow picture of what a race is about, but they actually get very little view of the real candidate. That leaves people worse off because they don’t know that they are uninformed. They are less cautious about their judgments of candidates.”
--John McManus, communications professor

TV occasionally does provide high-quality reporting; but watch out for the ordinary TV news.
OK, if you can't rely on the ordinary TV news you are most apt to watch, how about the newspaper? There you go. But what part of the newspaper? How about the list of


161
recommendations in the newspaper’s editorial page? This list usually appears in the days before the election. To be safe in adopting your paper's recommendations, you need to know the political ideology of the publisher that drives the recommendation process. Is your ideology the same as his or hers? Can you read a newspaper and figure out its ideology? That takes a great deal of skill. Better to ask someone who knows more about this than you do.
Like computer blogs, the newspaper columns written with a columnist's byline are another source of information. The writer of a newspaper column is like an editorial writer—opinions can be mixed in with the facts. Libel laws are looser for columnists; often they can get away with saying what a regular news story cannot. Columns can be helpful sources of information if the columnist is careful to give reasons for his or her opinions and is careful to distinguish the reasons from the opinions. The problem with editorials and columns that offer advice is that even if they give you reasons for the advice, you always have to worry that they are covering up other reasons that weigh against their advice.

Selective presentation of which information to withhold is a way to manipulate minds.

New stories, on the other hand, are supposed to be more sanitized, cleansed of opinions, full of facts, and more reliable. Very often they are. The best news stories are usually the ones that appear early in the campaign. In these, the writers interview the candidates and probe for positions on the important campaign issues. Writers of these early stories are usually the best informed of all the reporters on a newspaper's staff. Early on, the candidate isn't slinging so much mud and is trying to show the highly politicized voters, especially those who give campaign contributions or volunteer in campaigns, that he or she has significant positions on key issues and is a credible candidate. Later in the campaign, the atmosphere changes. The least politicized voters, those who are undecided as the election nears and those whose decision to vote for a candidate or ballot measure could be easily changed, are the primary target of the bulk of the campaign's media blitz. For these voters, the campaign will create short, memorable slogans plus blasts at the opposition. The newspapers (and web pages) then react and give primary attention to these slogans, to the mudslinging, and to the rise and fall of the polls. The issues take a back-burner.

When Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was campaigning for the U.S. presidency, much of the early coverage of his campaign was about whether he had slept with a woman who had been paid for her story to appear on the front page of a supermarket tabloid. The average voter kept thinking, "I want to hear about the issues," but the news reporters kept covering the sex angle. "This is all inane, stupid and insulting, and I hope the American people jam it down you-all's throat," said Bob Slagle, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Texas, when speaking to the press. "The national press corps is acting like a common street gossip in a small town." Meanwhile, the nation's top newspapers were trying to set things straight. On the same day, The Boston Globe's frontpage headline said, "Poll Shows Clinton's Lead Undiminished," while across town The Boston Herald's main headline said, "Clinton on the Run." Each paper frames the issues according to its publisher's politics. We get inconsistent headlines. So, we voters have a tough time, don't we?
The searching reader will have to look back on page fourteen in the newspaper for any in-depth reporting of the issues, and, even then, we readers need to be aware that story placement can be affected by the paper's editorial policy. Busy readers usually read only the headlines, and a story's

163
favorable treatment of a candidate can be torpedoed by an editor's unfavorable headline, regardless of what the reporter put into the story.
Other significant barriers block the sincere, interested reader who tries to use news stories as a source of information. Reporters too often fail to write stories that take the trouble to explain the issues, and it's not just that those stories aren't viewed by readers and editors as sufficiently entertaining. Explaining the news is harder work than simply stating what is new─the news. Also, there is little reward for writing in-depth reports. The reporter rarely gets a pat on the back from fellow reporters with the accompanying remark, "Beautiful piece of writing." There is no glamour in this part of the business.
In addition, a different factor obscures the public's vision of what is going on. The reporter's notion of objectivity gets in the way. When there are two candidates in an election, reporters often believe they must give equal weight and equal column space to both sides. The idea is to present the facts, then back off and let the voters decide for themselves. Unfortunately, this notion of fairness gets in the way when a campaign gets dirty and one candidate starts making false accusations about the opponent. The reporter sees what is going on but rarely will tell the public directly. Instead, when the attacked candidate tries to respond and say that the accusations are not true, the reporter will treat this reaction on a par with the smears themselves and will run the story with a headline "Mud flies," falsely suggesting to the public that both sides are engaging in negative campaigning. Paul Krugman once joked that "if one party declared that the earth was flat, the headlines would read Views Differ on Shape of Planet." The reporters are reluctant to tell what is really going on because they believe doing so would be putting their own judgment into a story, which it would be. However, the reporters often really are the only experts in touch with the readers, so if the experts won't tell the readers what is really going on, who will? Perhaps that is where the columnists and editors come in. Hmmm.
All in all, though, more good information is available than we are likely to take the trouble to use. The five best sources of information, not ranked in order of importance, are (1) the newspaper stories and magazine articles that profile the candidates and discuss the issues long before election day; (2) government voter pamphlets; (3) extended TV news programs; (4) public debates (but not the thirty-second TV summaries of the debates); and (5) the arguments of editors, columnists, and well-informed friends. All these are better than TV ads, campaign leaflets, blog entries, and sound bites on the ordinary TV news.
Fake News and Misinformation
Too often what looks like news is not news. It has been faked, and we have been misinformed. Someone wants us to believe it even though they know it is not true. We critical thinkers, need to keep up our defenses and not be naïve.

164
This was published as a news photo, but the original photo did not contain a flag.
In Chicago back in 2017, four black teenagers kidnapped and tortured a white teenager. Although the teenagers who committed this terrible act had no connection to the organization Black Lives Matter, an opponent of that organization quickly created a social network posting with the hashtag #BLMKidnapping about how the organization kidnapped and tortured a white person in Chicago. This led to a very large conversation about the topic, and the size of the conversation led other news organizations to repeat the claim that Black Lives Matter was thought to be involved. Repeating misinformation in new places made the misinformation more believable to many persons. The high interest in the story became news itself. Comments that BLM might not have been involved were little noticed among the noise in the tweetstorm. In fact, BLM was not involved.
Misinformation goes beyond the occasional hoax. It is a systematic attack on our brains. We critical thinkers seek the news, not the fake news. It is not always easy for us to tell the difference, but the more we know about fake news and how it is created, and the more pro-active we are, the easier it will be for us.
────CONCEPT CHECK────
Here is a critical thinking question about the following newspaper report.
In May 2016, a Facebook page called Heart of Texas urged its nearly 254,000 followers to rise up against what it considered to be an urgent cultural menace. A mosque in Houston

165
(Texas) had opened up a new library, and Heart of Texas planned to protest. "Stop Islamization of Texas," it warned.
Word of the protest spread quickly, but supporters of the mosque were also ready to mobilize. "Bigots are planning to intimidate through weaponized fear this Saturday at noon," one of them wrote on Reddit. The post linked to a Facebook page for United Muslims of America, a group that said it was planning a counter-protest for the same time and place.
…Heart of Texas wasn't a real group, as Business Insider later reported. United Muslims of America is a real organization, but the Facebook page promoting the counter-protest was not run by the actual group, as The Daily Beast found. Instead, according to documents made public last week by the Senate Intelligence Committee, both the pro- and anti-mosque protests had been planned and promoted by Russian trolls.
…A few dozen real Americans did protest that Saturday in Houston. videos of the protest show real emotion—people on opposite sides of the street screaming, swearing and truly angry to have to share the country with the bozos on the other side.
…In response to Heart of Texas' "Stop Islamization" post, a Facebook user upset with the Houston mosque posted a comment suggesting that it be blown up.

166
Trolls are people paid to spread comments on social media platforms such as Facebook. Now for the question about all this: Were news reports of the feelings of the Houston demonstrators an example of fake news?
a. yes b. no
────127
We learned today that the Jefferson County sheriff is part owner of a brothel in nearby South Chesterton, and he seems to be behind the training of high school girls to be prostitutes. Now he's running for Congress. No surprise that the Democratic Party is funding his campaign. Oh, I forgot to mention that a manager of Burger Queen in Florida admitted that her company has been using 20% Vietnam dog meat and 5% Kenya zebra meat in all its burgers. Not just this year, but for the last twenty years! Yuk!
Interesting? Yes. True? No. Tweets with false news spread faster and spread to more people than real news, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab who did a large study of Twitter stories spanning 2006 to 2017. "It's sort of disheartening at first to realize how much we humans are responsible," said Sinan Aral, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and an author of the study. His point: we humans are inclined to prefer false news to real news. To quote from this study by the M.I.T. researchers,
The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news.
ꟷ"The Spread of True and False News Online," by Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral, Science, 09 Mar 2018, page 1146.
Real news tends to be less interesting than fake news. It's exciting to read that a famous sports star burned the American flag in the locker room and the Secretary of State had a pedophilia group hidden in a room in a pizza restaurant. Interesting but fake.
If you cannot quickly sort the real from the fake because it is not about your area of expertise, then you are apt to look for help. Most persons do not know an expert who can tell the difference

---------127 No, the protesters' actions and emotions were genuine. What was fake news were the postings by the Russian trolls who were engaged in an online disinformation campaign. It is a cost-effective strategy for Russia, says U.S. Senator Angus Stanley King, Jr. of Maine: "For the price of one F-35 airplane, the Russians can hire 5,000 hackers."

167
between genuine and fake, so they usually look to the groups they already identify with for what to believe about a story. They ask, “What are my people saying about this?” or “What do the places I trust say about it?” Most persons will not check for themselves. Who has the time? The powers behind the fake news know this, and they exploit it. They design fake news that is especially interesting to special groups of social media users, news that the users would wish were true. Who doesn't want their enemy to look bad?
The most effective creator of fake news is someone who successfully slips fake news in among the genuine news at news sites. News sites sometimes find the news for themselves, but because doing original journalistic research is expensive, very often a news site will pick up news from another news site and publish it on their own site. In this way a fake news story that was embedded into one of those news sites will more likely to spread across the news media, and occasionally to news sites we, or “our people,” use and trust.
Luckily for us critical thinkers, the very best sources of news have their own defenses up and do not re-broadcast fake news. At the very least they will precede the news item with the phrase, “According to so and so,” or “As reported in....” Also, they will be clear about when they are offering news and when they are offering advertising and when they are offering more disguised advertising that is usually called “sponsored content.” Ads do not come to us with a tag that says, “Hey, I am an ad,” do they? So, it takes some critical thinking to separate them from the news.
Think about that last Twitter message you read. How do you know whether it came from a real human user or from a re-tweeting bot [that is, a software robot, an automated account] that automatically generates spam to make an issue seem to be more popular than it really is? A bot can turn a minor hashtag into a trending hashtag that catches the eye of journalists who re-mention the issue on more mainstream news sites. A trending item is one that gets the clicks, and the trending items spread more easily to a bigger audience. The bot-maker thinks, “Create a trend, and you create believers.”
Here are some very unreliable sources of information in the United States: the newspaper National Enquirer, the newspaper Weekly World News, and the website World News Daily Report. Here are some very reliable sources of information: peer-reviewed scientific journals, the magazine The Economist, and these four daily newspapers: The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post. There are, of course, many reliable sources of information that are not American. “Peer reviewed” means that other experts in the relevant field act as referees who must approve in advance the publication of the article. The best peer reviewing is via blind refereeing, which means that, during the referee process or decision process about whether to publish, the author is never told the names of the referees, and the referees are never told the name of the author. This promotes objectivity. Unfortunately, no method will absolutely guarantee objectivity.

168
Why should Americans believe that their traditional news organizations are trustworthy? The reporter Steve Inskeep at National Public Radio answered this question:
Many news organizations produce stories that are checked before publication. Others don't. It's a big deal. Hiring an editorial staff shows the publication's respect for you…. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, for example, have different owners, audiences, stories, perspectives and obsessions. Both have made mistakes and omissions; but both send reporters out into the world and back them up with an editorial process that catches and corrects many errors. This means both can be informative, regardless of your politics or theirs.
When we say a traditional news source backs up its reporters with an editorial process that catches errors, what does this mean? It means that the editors press their reporters to double check the reports, and it means the editors recommend the reporter get at least a second, independent source for any unusual claims about situations that the reporter is not a direct witness to. Unlike so many blogs, the mainstream news organizations employ professionals who are devoted to separating fact from fiction. And for them, making up sources is a great sin.
We critical thinkers need to be alert to the difference between claims that are backed up by reasons and claims that are not. If we are given reasons, we should ask ourselves whether those reasons are good enough. Also, we should ask ourselves, “Am I forwarding this twitter feed to my friends because it is interesting and because I know it to be true, or only because it is interesting?” Think before pressing the "share" button. Does that tweet you received about "breaking news," even contain a link to a credible news source, or is it just an interesting claim?
Some news stories that we suspect could be fake can be checked by us for accuracy by our visiting the websites Snopes.com or FactCheck.org or Politifact.com. They specialize in verifying which interesting news stories are true and which are misleading or totally false. Be alert that some fake news stories might say, “as verified by Snopes.com,” even though Snopes.com actually has done no such thing, and the faker is saying this just to discourage any attempt by us to do more checking.
Nobody can check regularly on hundreds of news sources, nor even read or view them. Most people will find one or two news sources they trust, and then put their investigative skills on cruise control and just absorb whatever those news sources say. This procedure can be very efficient time-wise, but it occasionally can be dangerous. We need to do our own checking once in a while, even with the news sites we usually trust, especially for the really important news that might cause us to say, “That news means my congressperson is a criminal,” or “If that’s true, then it was their country who provoked our country, not the other way around, so we need to retaliate now,” or “That means that what he did is the reason why people like me don’t have a better job.”

169
Unfortunately, there are news organizations who have decided that profit is their main goal and that it is more profitable to get their audience to feel informed than to be informed. As noted above, acquiring information is expensive. Having their own professional, investigative reporters rather than just writers or “news anchors” is a large, extra expense. It is much cheaper simply to re-broadcast some other organization’s news, and to re-shape it so that one's own audience is told what to believe. The audience leaves feeling informed without being informed. We critical thinkers cannot usually spot this behavior with just a few interactions with the news organization. It takes many interactions and a great deal of sophisticated critical thinking on our part in order to tell which specific news organizations emphasize cost-effective re-shaping of news and which organizations gather news themselves or are very careful about which news sources they themselves use.
If we are checking on a political news item for ourselves, it can be helpful to see whether the item is considered to be news by sources that do not have our own politics. Regarding American TV news organizations, MSNBC is left-wing, CNN is middle of the road, and Fox News is right-wing. If all three report it, then it is probably true, but if it appears on MSNBC News, let’s say, and not Fox News, that isn't a good reason to believe it is not true. It might be true but not be reported on by Fox simply because it is less interesting to them or goes against their politics.
It can be an eye-opening experience to see how the very same story is treated so differently by the above three news organizations. No news source is value-free. Their politics intrude in the phrasing, in what headline is chosen, and in what information is not mentioned—in how they "frame" the news.
The spread of fake news from fraudulent sources has been a problem ever since civilization began, but it is only a symptom: The larger problem is that too many people will doubt a claim simply because it does come from establishment sources—governments, scientists, daily newspapers, TV news programs—when in fact these are reliable authorities. These skeptical people are being naïve when they dismiss real news from traditional sources that are trustworthy. Their alienation from “the establishment” makes them easy receptacles for accepting fake news and rejecting real news.
On the other hand, in many countries the government is too often involved in promoting propaganda and misinformation. The government in turn pressures the newspapers and TV stations they control. If you are living in this situation, then there is good reason to be alienated from the establishment and to be less trustful of its news. Here is a BuzzFeed link to a video showing the Egyptian Minister of Culture telling a crowd that the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted to creating the terrorist organization ISIS (Islamic State). Lebanese media were spreading the same story. How do you know she didn’t create ISIS? Were you there to see for yourself?

170
Well, you can go to FactCheck.org | Search | Clinton ISIS, and read what FactCheck has to say about whether she did.
Over the years, the U.S. has had its share of corruption within its news establishment, but a smaller share than in the average country.
Critical thinkers should be on the alert for reports containing denunciations of "the right" or “the left” or "Washington" or "the media" or "their supporters." These denunciations should be viewed with suspicion and greatly discounted. Good reporters do not appeal to these vague terms and are more specific about who is making a claim about what.
To repeat the point made earlier about double checking, we critical thinkers have a responsibility to occasionally do some checking ourselves on the reporters and their sources. If we check the occasional claim by viewing the reporter’s own sources for ourselves and by trying to find an independent source who covered the same issue, then we can assign more trust to this reporter in the future.
Critical thinkers should follow President Ronald Reagan’s advice: “trust but verify.” That is, do not always mistrust what someone says, but do demand verification of their claim before we buy it hook, line, and sinker—especially if the claim is surprising and, if we were to trust it, then we would have to reject many of our other beliefs.
A single fact seems puny compared to our ideology—the large set of our beliefs that helps define our worldview. Unfortunately, too many of us, when confronted with a fact that runs counter to our ideology, will immediately discount that fact as our opponent’s partisan opinion. We will not take the trouble to do any of our own fact checking. It is always easier to hunker down secure with our ideology than to take a challenging comment seriously and check on it for ourselves.

171
What about confronting the person you believe is responsible for promoting fake news? This can be a dangerous thing to do depending on the political situation in which you live. In some countries you could get arrested just for confronting that person. But let’s suppose you are in the United States. In the U.S., the powers behind the fake news, the people who employ bloggers and newscasters to push false news at you, never will be able to have you arrested even if they would like to, but they never will confess to what they are doing when confronted. Most likely they will ignore you. However, sometimes they will attack you. They will yell back; or, in a more public setting, instead of yelling back, they will respond in flowery, formal language such as, “It is clear that absurdity is no prohibition on the actions of you and your sources.” The counter from the faker is very often to say that your facts are just partisan opinions. The faker will try to turn the tables. If that happens, you two are not having a reasoned interchange, and you probably should follow the advice of the American Revolutionary and colonist Thomas Paine:
To argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead.
But if you have no effect on the faker, at least your discoveries will have a positive effect on you, yourself. You will learn better how to separate the genuine news from the fake. You will better understand that facts are something more solid than mere opinions of the people who hold microphones.
You can learn a bit about fake news by looking at the publishing situation from the perspective of the originator of the fake news. Put yourself in the shoes of the faker. Why do you produce fake news? Because you believe the end justifies the means. You believe that achieving your goal justifies using unethical methods to achieve it.
Once you have created your fake news, which is, let’s say, an article smearing a political candidate who is opposed by the people who hired you, the best way to get it out there circulating among the news outlets is to send it to a news organization that has low investigative standards and that will see your story as good news, or as the sort of story that entertains their intended audience. They will accept your story without checking on it very much, so long as it seems plausible to them. Then, hopefully, other news organizations will pick up your story from that first news organization and use it for their sites. Now your story has momentum. Another successful day for you. If it goes viral, you might get a raise.
However, suppose later that some self-styled critical thinker or some other media people come back at you and demand to know your evidence. You don’t have any. So, what do you do? The only rational response is to stop talking to those people, isn’t it? Or you call your doctor—your spin doctor whose primary skill is deflection of criticism and counterattack against the critic.

That's how you have made your own decision. Is it a reasonable one? Yes, because it is based on high-quality reasoning. Is it the best decision--the one an expert would have made in your place? You don’t know this, but yes, the experts do say that stream water will be safe if you boil it for a minute or two. Giardia is caused by protozoa which can’t live for long at high temperature. Other micro-organisms can survive this heating, but they usually won’t cause any human illness. The reason people use water-purification tablets instead of boiling is for convenience; using the tablets avoids all the extra time for the water to boil and then later to cool down to drinking temperature.

Now let's turn to the principles of logical reasoning that have been used in this situation. The principles, which are the focus of the next section, are neither rules nor recipes; they are pieces of advice that must be applied flexibly. They are called "principles" only because it sounds odd to call something "piece of advice eleven" or "thing to do seven."

Advice for Logical Reasoners

All of us use these principles every day, so this discussion is just a reminder of what you already know. One principle is to ask for reasons before accepting a claim or conclusion, unless you already have good enough reasons. You applied this principle when you asked Juanita why she thought it best to leave. Similarly, if you expect people to accept your own claim, then it's your responsibility to give them reasons they can appreciate.

If you expect people to accept your own conclusion, then it's your responsibility to give them reasons they can appreciate.

Let's examine that last remark. A conclusion (a claim) backed up by one or more reasons in any order is called an argument, even when the reasoner is not being argumentative or disagreeable. The word “argument” is a technical term we will be using frequently in this course. Being logical means, among other things, that you should give an argument to support your claim if you expect other people to accept it. But give people arguments they can understand. Don't get overly technical. Otherwise, you might as well be talking gobbledygook. Tailor your reasons to your audience. Your goal in giving an argument is to design your reasons so that your audience sees that the reasons imply the conclusion. Another way of saying this is that your audience should see that the conclusion follows from the reasons given to support it.

CONCEPT CHECK────

Which of the following passages contain an argument in our technical sense of that word?

a. I hate you. Get out of here!

b. I'm sure Martin Luther King Jr. didn't die during the 1960s, because it says right here in the encyclopedia that he was assassinated in Memphis in 1998.

c. The Republican Party began back in the 1850s as a U.S. political party. Abraham Lincoln was their first candidate to win the presidency.

d. I don’t believe you when you say Martin Luther King Jr. could have been elected president if he hadn’t been assassinated.

Try to discipline yourself to read and answer these sample exercises before looking up the correct answer in the footnote below, and before reading on. You do not need to write out the answer. The exercises are designed to test your understanding of concepts in the material you have just read. If you can answer the Concept Checks, then you will be ready to tackle the more difficult exercises at the end of each chapter.

────1

Let's continue with our introduction to the principles of logical reasoning. (There are quite a few more principles to be uncovered.) For example, in the camping-trip story, you paid attention both to what Juanita said and to what Emilio said, and you wished there was a park ranger nearby to ask about Giardia. The underlying principle you applied is to recognize the value of having more relevant information. In the camping situation, it would not have been irrational to choose to pack up and go home, but it probably wouldn’t have been the best decision. The point is to make your decision on the basis of a serious attempt to assess the relevant evidence. You did this when you paid attention to probabilities and consequences--you weighed the pros and cons--of going or staying. That is, you weighed the benefits and drawbacks.

1 The answer to the present Concept Check is (b), even though there is an error in the encyclopedia because King was really assassinated in 1968. Choice (a) is not the correct answer because, although it does show two people having a disagreement, neither one is arguing in our technical sense of “argument,” because neither is giving reasons for what is said. Choice (c), on the other hand, merely describes the Republican Party. One moral to draw from this Concept Check is that an argument based on incorrect information is still an argument; a bad argument is still an argument. A second moral is that an argument can have just one reason, although most arguments use more than one.

Here's a picture above of what to do. Think of a balance scale in which objects can be placed on either side of the scale. Put the pros on one side and the cons on the other, but assess each one by its significance or "weight." After all the pros and cons are assessed this way and added onto the scale, the winner is the side that tilts downward. Some considerations weigh more than others, so it's not just a matter of which side has a longer list of reasons. Weighing means considering how much you'd gain or lose if one of the consequences were to occur. Also, you should consider how probable it is that a particular consequence would really occur. Don't give much weight to a possible consequence that is one in a million.

More precisely stated, the procedure of weighing the pros and cons is a decision procedure that requires

(1) considering the possible courses of action (pack up and hike back out, stay and boil the water, go on a search for a wet leaf to lick, and so forth),

(2) guessing the consequences of those various courses of action (being thirsty, continuing the camping trip, getting a disease),

(3) evaluating those consequences (being thirsty is a negative, continuing the camping trip is a positive, getting a disease from Giardia would be terrible), and

(4) considering the probabilities that those various consequences will actually occur (It is 100 percent probable that you won't be thirsty after you drink from the stream. It is only very slightly probable that you'll catch a disease if you drink boiled water.)

8

It can be helpful to delay making important decisions when that is practical. During the extra time, you will have an opportunity to think through the problem more carefully. You could discover consequences of your decision that you might not have thought of at first. For example, in the camping situation with Emilio and Juanita, you might have quickly agreed to let Emilio taste the water first to see whether it had Giardia. Perhaps only later would you have thought about the consequence of his becoming too sick to hike back out of the forest. Would you have been able to carry him back to safety? Faced with a question of what to do or believe, logical reasoners try to weigh the pros and cons if they have the time; they search around for reasons that might favor their conclusion while not hiding anything negative. That is, they identify the reasons in favor of taking a specific position on the issue, and they identify the reasons against taking that position; then they weigh the two sets of reasons and arrive at a conclusion fairly.

────CONCEPT CHECK────

Which pair does not fit with the others?

• strong points and weak points

• advantages and drawbacks

• highs and lows

• positives and negatives

The answer is:

2 Highs and lows. All the others are about pros and cons.

Here is a second example of logical reasoning that weighs the pros and cons. Imagine that a few days ago you promised Emilio you would go to the movies with him this Friday evening. You have every intention of going, but you are mildly considering going with Juanita instead, and telling Emilio you are sick, even though you aren’t sick. Telling him you are sick while instead going with Juanita would be called an alternative action. Let's weigh the pros and cons of taking the original action or this alternative action. (We won't consider other alternative actions, such as asking Emilio whether Juanita can go with the two of you.)

One possible consequence of going only with Juanita is that you would have more fun. It's not that you would have no fun with Emilio; it's just that you believe it would be more fun to go only with Juanita, all other things being equal. You estimate that the odds are about 60-40 in favor of

9

more fun if you go with Juanita instead of Emilio. Another possible consequence is that Juanita will at first be flattered that you asked her to go with you.

There is still another possible consequence to consider: You will be breaking your promise to Emilio, which would be morally wrong and thus have a negative value. It wouldn't be as negative as letting Emilio drink water that you know will cause a disease, but it is clearly negative, and the probability of this consequence is 100 percent; that is, it is certain to occur if you tell Emilio you are sick. In addition, if Emilio finds out, then your friendship with him might end. This is also a negative, and one that is likely to occur, but then again Emilio might never find out what you’ve done. Finally, there is one more consequence worth considering: If Juanita finds out you broke your promise to Emilio, she will consider you less trustworthy than she originally thought. This is a negative, too. At this point, you cannot think of any other consequences that should be taken into account.

After pondering all this, you realize that it is likely that most of the negative consequences will actually occur if you do go out with Juanita, and these negatives are worse than the extra fun you’d have with Juanita and that it's only about sixty percent likely that you will have more fun with Juanita. So, the negatives weigh more than the positives. After weighing the pros and cons of the two alternatives this way, you decide to keep your promise to Emilio. That is logical reasoning in action.

A critical thinker doesn't always use the procedure of weighing the pros and cons. Weighing the pros and cons will give you a good answer only in limited situations where you know the important consequences of your potential actions and where you have enough time to consider those consequences. In many situations, the best thinking requires taking shortcuts--making quick guesses or relying on a trusted friend to make the decision for you.

Logical reasoners need to be flexible thinkers. For example, in a situation where you're playing baseball and a friend yells "Duck!" it is illogical to spend much time searching around for good reasons. The logical thing to do is to duck down immediately. Nevertheless, even in this situation you didn't duck without a good reason. You know from previous experience that "Duck" said in a certain tone of voice means that there is a danger to your head that requires lowering it fast and protecting it from a sudden impact. You know not to stick your head up and say "Where's the duck?" Similarly, if someone were to run out of the Wells Fargo Bank building shouting, "Look out, the bank is being robbed," it wouldn't be logical to spend much time wondering what river bank the person is talking about. The point is that logical reasoners assess what is said in light of the situation. That is all part of our common sense.

Be sensitive to the situation. If you happen to know what time it is when someone passes you on the street and asks you, "Do you know the time?" it is illogical to answer only "Yes" and walk away─ unless you are trying to irritate the person who asked the question.

Real life decision-making often must work in a dynamic, unpredictable environment. In the business world, new competitors appear, prices rise or fall, opportunities that were available at one time are not available at another. The uncritical decision maker is unaware of these changes and continues to make decisions as if in the old environment. Alert decision makers understand the need to know when time is getting short and a decision is needed. This sort of recognition requires frequently asking in the background, “Should I continue to weigh the pros and cons, or should I stop and act now?”────3 Like everyone else, you are curious, so you are open to adding new beliefs to your old beliefs. There are logical--that is, appropriate--ways of doing this, as well as illogical ones. The goal is to add truths, not falsehoods. For example, you are waiting in the grocery store checkout line and

The less time available, the more rational it becomes to be reactive and to act on intuitions or ‘gut instinct.’

 ────CONCEPT CHECK──── Ramone's friend says, "Ramone, look at those two white guys on the other side of the street. They look friendly. The blond guy with him looks like he would rip your lungs out just to see what would happen. The other one is just as fierce, and he's carrying the radio I lost yesterday; it's got my sticker on the side." If Ramone leaves believing that the two guys are friendly because his friend said, "They look friendly," then he has violated some principle of logical reasoning. What principle?

• Reasons should be tailored to the audience.

• Don't take people too literally.

 • Consider the possible courses of action.

 • Weigh the pros and cons.

The answer is

3 The second choice is correct. From what else the friend says, you should be able to tell he was being sarcastic and wasn't serious about the two guys being friendly. He didn't mean for Ramone to take his statements literally.

────3 Like everyone else, you are curious, so you are open to adding new beliefs to your old beliefs. There are logical--that is, appropriate--ways of doing this, as well as illogical ones. The goal is to add truths, not falsehoods. For example, you are waiting in the grocery store checkout line and notice a magazine’s front-page headline, "World War II Bomber Discovered Intact on Surface of Moon."

11

You didn't know that, did you? Well, it wouldn't be logical to believe it. Why not? Here are three reasons: (1) Bombers can't fly to the moon, (2) no one is going to bust the national budget to send one there by rocket ship, and (3) there aren't any alien-piloted UFOs that snatch military antiques. The principle behind this logical reasoning is:

Use your background knowledge and common sense in drawing conclusions.

There is a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon in which Calvin finds some charred rocks and ashes in his back yard and claims this is dramatic proof that UFOs landed in his backyard. That cartoon also illustrates the following principle that should be used by logical reasoners:

Extraordinary statements require extraordinarily good evidence to back them up.

A bit of charcoal is not extraordinarily good evidence of a UFO landing, but you ought to have extraordinarily good evidence if you are going to believe in such an unlikely event. Most every reader of the cartoon knows that, except Calvin, so that is why it is humorous.

Similarly, if I were to say to you, “I met my friend Tiffany Whetstone at the Co-op Grocery yesterday afternoon," you would demand very little evidence that this is so. Perhaps the confirming word of a mutual friend would settle any doubts you might have. However, if I were to say to you, “I met my friend Tiffany Whetstone, who has been dead for the last ten years, at the Co-op Grocery yesterday afternoon," you would probably think I was lying or crazy. You certainly would demand extraordinarily good evidence before accepting what I said as true. In this case, even a confirmation by our mutual friend would be insufficient evidence. However, suppose I said instead, “I met my friend Tiffany Whetstone at the Co-op Grocery yesterday afternoon. She has a wooden leg and had just won two sets yesterday in her doubles tennis match. She is the best player on her tennis team in Antarctica." You ought to think I was joking. If you find that I’m not, then you ought to think that my statement is weird, though not as weird as the one about her being dead for ten years.

12

It could be true that she played tennis in Antarctica and has a wooden leg, but you ought to suspend belief until you get some very good evidence. By not relying on the principles of logical reasoning, some people are apt to make the mistake of believing too easily that there are World War II bombers on the moon, that UFOs have landed in someone's backyard, and that dead friends have come back to life. All these things might have happened, but currently available evidence is extremely weak. The only reason to believe these things is that a few people have said they’ve happened. And you have lots of background beliefs and common sense that suggest these things very probably did not happen. It is a sign of being logical if the degree of confidence you have in your reasons directly affects the degree of confidence you place in the conclusion drawn from those reasons. A person who believes strongly even though the reasons are flimsy is being stubborn or dogmatic.

────CONCEPT CHECK──── Here are three arguments about the issue of how David's uncle died. All three are arguing for the same conclusion--that David's uncle died of a drug overdose. Which of these arguments should be considered the most convincing, using only your background knowledge and common sense?

a. David said that his uncle died of a drug overdose, so his uncle must have died of a drug overdose.

b. David's uncle died of a drug overdose because we know that David predicted two years ago that this is how his uncle would die.

c. Look, the coroner's report specifically says that David's uncle is dead. Also, everybody in the neighborhood knows that the uncle did drugs every day. So, his uncle died of a drug overdose. I don’t know what David thinks, though.

────4 4 Answer (a) provides the best reason to believe that David's uncle died of a drug overdose. Although the world has lots of liars in it, we generally take people at their word unless we have a reason to be suspicious. Answers (b) and (c) give worse reasons. Answer (b) asks us to believe David's prediction from two years earlier. It makes more sense to trust what David is saying today (which is what we have in answer (a)) than what he said two years ago about the future. Answer (c) gives us a very good reason to believe that the uncle is dead but gives only a very weak reason about the cause of death. Maybe the uncle did drugs but got hit by a truck. So, answer (a) is best. (The best information would be the coroner's report or a police report on what caused the death, but you don’t have that information to use.)

13

Following the rules of logical reasoning comes more easily to some people than to others. All of us, however, are capable of improvement, and we all should want to improve, because improvement has a yield, a payoff: you tend to minimize your false beliefs, and you perform actions that don’t have such bad consequences.

Being logical isn't the only way to make high quality decisions. Sometimes these decisions are made by accident; sometimes they are made in illogical ways, such as by following a horoscope. In the long run, however, statistics show that the smart money is on logical reasoners. Logical reasoning pays. When the expert says, "Hey, don't drink that stuff; it could kill you," the logical reasoner will defer to the expert and put down the cup. The irrational thinker will think, "Experts have been wrong in the past; I'm drinking anyway."

Everyone knows that the best decisions are based on facts, but how do we go about distinguishing facts from all the opinions we are faced with? This book provides many helpful hints on this topic. One hint is that a fact is the same thing as a truth, and a truth does not change depending upon how many people accept it. A second hint is to avoid accepting inconsistencies; they are a sure sign of error. We made use of this logical-reasoning principle when we noticed that Juanita's advice to end the camping trip was inconsistent with Emilio's advice to continue it. Detecting an inconsistency doesn't reveal where the fault lies, but it does tell us that a fault is present. If some man says the surface of Neptune on average is colder than 200 degrees below zero, and his sister says that it's not nearly that cold, one of the two must be wrong about the facts. We know this even if we don't know the facts about Neptune. So, one of the cardinal principles of logical reasoning is:

Be consistent in your own reasoning and be on the lookout for inconsistency in the reasoning of others.

Here is a definition of inconsistency:

Definition Statements are logically inconsistent if they conflict so that at least one of them must be false because together they imply something is so and also not so. Similarly, a group of instructions is inconsistent if together the instructions imply that somebody must both do and not do something.

14

────CONCEPT CHECK────

Which of the following, if any, are most likely not principles of logical reasoning?

• Don't accept inconsistent beliefs.

• You ought to give an argument in defense of what you want another person to believe.

• The degree of confidence you have in your reasons should affect the degree of confidence you have in your conclusion.

────5

Statements are logically inconsistent with each other if you can tell just from their meaning that they can't all be true. A group of statements is logically consistent if it's not logically inconsistent. Because a statement is usually made with a declarative sentence, we commonly speak of sentences being consistent or inconsistent with each other and don’t mention the word “declarative.” Also, we usually don’t use the word “logically.”

────CONCEPT CHECK────

Create two sentences about basketball that are inconsistent with each other.

Examples of Good Reasoning

So far, we've explored the importance of reasoning logically in situations that require a decision--either a decision about what to do or a decision about what to believe. Along the way we've introduced a variety of rules of thumb for high-quality reasoning. We have called these principles of logical reasoning. We have examined short examples of good reasoning and short examples of bad reasoning. The Giardia example was a long example of good reasoning.

5 All are principles of good reasoning.

6 Michael Jordan was a pro basketball player. No, he wasn't.

pg15

Here is a second, long example--one that is slightly more complicated and uses some other especially interesting principles of good reasoning. The scene is a jury room in which jurors are discussing whether Jesse Mayfield is guilty of armed robbery. The State of Alabama, represented by the prosecutor, has charged Mayfield with using a handgun to hold up the All-Night Grocery in downtown Birmingham.

Juror Washington Jones begins the dialogue by reasoning about the case presented by the prosecuting district attorney against Mayfield. Another juror, Dr. White, disagrees with what juror Jones says. Each of the two speakers offers his own argument about which explanation of the defendant's actions is best.

Jones: OK, let's consider what we know. We know there was a crime, since we can believe the grocery owner's testimony that all the night's receipts are missing. The grocery clerk confirmed that testimony. She is the lone eyewitness to the crime; there were no others in the store at 2 a.m., when she said the crime was committed. We also know the grocery's videotaping system had been broken all week. The prosecutor has also proved that Mayfield arrived at the grocery that night at about 2 a.m. The evidence for that is that the time was on the grocery receipt found in his wastebasket when the police arrested Mayfield at his house later that morning. Mayfield matches the general description of the robber given by the clerk at 2:30 a.m., when she talked to the police. So, we've got to conclude that Mayfield was in the store at 2 a.m. and that the robbery occurred before 2:30 a.m., probably at 2 a.m. The clerk also stated that the robber ran out of the store and headed into a nearby apartment complex. Mayfield lives in an apartment in the direction she pointed to. A neighbor told the police that Mayfield ran up his apartment's steps sometime

16

around 2 a.m. that night. What else do we know that can be considered as evidence against Mayfield? Let’s see. Mayfield has no record of robbery, but he was convicted of minor assault against a neighbor six years ago. Well, that's about it. Does that make the case for the prosecution?

Dr. White: Yes, he's guilty; there's no other explanation for the evidence. I say we vote right now.

Jones: Hold it, Doc. There is another explanation, and Mayfield's defense attorney gave it to us. Maybe Mayfield was there all right, but just to buy a bottle of whiskey, and the clerk stole the money that night after Mayfield left. She could have hidden the cash and then called the cops. The whole case against Mayfield hangs on what she alone says. Mayfield says he is innocent, but he admits being in the store in the early morning to buy whiskey. The prosecutor admitted that none of the stolen money was found, and no gun was found. So, all the facts fit that other explanation just as well as the prosecution's explanation. Besides, there is an additional reason to suspect the clerk: The defense has shown that she was thrown out of her college sorority for stealing their petty cash. I say the defense attorney has shown that Mayfield could have been framed. Sure, there's some evidence against Mayfield, but not enough.

Dr. White: Mayfield is as guilty as sin. He won't even look the judge or the prosecutor in the eye when they talk to him. Very suspicious. You left that out of the story, Jones. Mayfield's an alcoholic, too. Think of the number of crimes committed by alcoholics. They need that next drink, right? Also, even though he now admits being in the All-Night Grocery that morning, Mayfield lied about being there when he was first arrested, didn't he?

Jones: Yes, but what does that prove? He was arrested with his wife present, which is why he lied about being there, according to his defense attorney. He said she wouldn't let him buy whiskey with her money. Now, about that guilty look. Guilty looks don't make you guilty. I can think of ten reasons why he looked that way. The case against Mayfield isn't proven, at least not beyond a shadow of a doubt. Better that five robbers go free than one innocent person gets locked up. What do the rest of you jurors think?

Dr. White: That's just crap! He's guilty! Listen, you can't call that nice young white clerk a liar. It's Mayfield who's the liar!

If all this is supposed to contain an example of good reasoning, what is so good about it? Well, first, Jones uses the following principle of logical reasoning when he is explaining the facts of the robbery case: Explanations should fit all the relevant facts. Second, Jones demonstrates good reasoning in that he understands his responsibility to back up his conclusion that the case against Mayfield isn't strong enough. Jones backs it up by showing that a second explanation, the frame-up story, fits the facts just as well. In doing so, he listens to the opposition, tries to consider all the evidence, and weighs the pros and cons. By pointing to the defense attorney's explanation of the facts and cautioning his fellow jurors that the D.A. has not presented enough evidence, Jones uses a key principle of logical reasoning:

17

Your opponent's explanation is less believable if you can show that there are alternative explanations that haven't been ruled out.

Jones demonstrates an understanding of the fact that weaker reasons require a more cautious conclusion; he doesn't overstate his conclusion. He is careful to follow the principle: Don't draw a conclusion until you've gotten enough evidence; he doesn’t rush to judgment. Jones obeys another principle of logical reasoning: Stick to the subject. White goes off on a tangent, talking about alcoholism and whether Mayfield looked the judge and DA in the eye. The comment about the clerk being white is also irrelevant, and probably racist. On the other hand, all of Jones's remarks are relevant.

There is much more that could be said regarding the reasoning in this robbery case. We won’t pursue this case study any more, but in later chapters we will explore all the principles of logical reasoning that were just mentioned. This chapter has looked at some examples of good reasoning from ordinary citizens. As a group, however, scientists who are reasoning in their area of expertise are perhaps our society's best examples of critical thinkers. By and large most of them, most of the time, are doing the best they can to reason carefully and critically. Of course sometimes they make mistakes; they are only human.

This book is concerned with many other kinds of reasoning, not just with argumentation. For example, when you are trying to summarize a complicated explanation of allowable deductions on I.R.S. income tax form 1040 Schedule C, you are not arguing, but you are doing some critical thinking. Your critical thinking skills also involve assessing whether a group of sentences are consistent, whether a proposed definition is successful, whether an advertisement gives any useful information about a product, whether a speaker is being fair in a debate with an opponent, whether a statistical sample was biased, and whether someone's supposed scientific explanation is unscientific. This book is designed to improve all these other critical thinking skills, too, even though they don't directly involve arguments.

Review of Major Points

This chapter emphasized that logical reasoning is your guide to good decisions. It is also a guide to sorting out truth from falsehood. This chapter began with several case studies of logical reason-ing. It also pointed out some common errors in reasoning. From these examples we were able to extract the following principles of logical reasoning: (1) ask for reasons before accepting a

18

conclusion, (2) give an argument to support your conclusion, (3) tailor reasons to your audience, (4) design your reasons to imply the conclusion, (5) recognize the value of having more relevant information, (6) weigh the pros and cons, (7) consider the possible courses of action, (8) look at the consequences of these various courses of action, (9) evaluate the consequences, (10) consider the probabilities that those various consequences will actually occur, (11) delay making important decisions when practical, (12) assess what is said in light of the situation, (13) don't take people too literally, (14) use your background knowledge and common sense in drawing conclusions, (15) remember that extraordinary statements require extraordinarily good evidence, (16) defer to the expert, (17) remember that firmer conclusions require better reasons, (18) be consistent in your own reasoning, (19) be on the lookout for inconsistency in the reasoning of yourself and others, (20) check to see whether explanations fit all the relevant facts, (21) you can make your opponent's explanation less believable by showing that there are alternative explanations that haven't been ruled out, (22) stick to the subject, and (23) don't draw a conclusion until you’ve gotten enough evidence.

These principles are merely pieces of advice; they are not rules or recipes. All the points, principles, and problems discussed in this chapter will receive more detailed treatment in later chapters. Those chapters will continue to systematically explore the intricacies of being logical. Although not all the logical principles in the world will be introduced in this book, all the most important ones will be. Regarding the problem of whether some are more important than others: not to worry; the relative importance of the principles will become clear as we go along.

As you investigate arguments during the course, you will improve the following skills:

• RECOGNITION of arguments

• EVALUATION of arguments

• CREATION of arguments

“Critical thinking is skeptical without being cynical. It is open-minded without being wishy-washy. It is analytical without being nitpicky. Critical thinking can be decisive without being stubborn, evaluative without being judgmental, and forceful without being opinionated.”

Every argument contains at least one intended conclusion plus one or more supporting reasons, called premises. However, in some passages it is not easy to tell whether an argument occurs at all, nor what the premises and conclusion of an argument really are, nor how other arguments in the passage are related to that argument. This chapter explores that understatement. It begins with an introduction of special phrases that often indicate the presence of premises and conclusions. Then the chapter investigates the problems of identifying the unstated premises and conclusions. For especially complex argumentation, the chapter introduces a diagramming technique that can provide a helpful display of the argument structure.
What is a Statement?
Statements are what is said. More accurate, statements are things that are said that are either true or false. They are also called claims. Here is one: "The homicide rate in England was fifty times higher in the fourteenth century than it is today." Here is another: “Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system.” Both of these statements happen to be true. A statement that is especially important to us might be called a proposition, assertion, judgment, hypothesis, principle, thesis, or, in some situations, a law. Statements have to be capable of being true or false even if we don't know which. So, if you say, “Is it midnight?” then you've not made a statement. Suggestions, commands, and proposals aren’t statements either. The suggestion “We should get a new refrigerator,” and the command, “Stand back!” and the proposal, “Let’s quit studying,” are not statements. It would be very odd to call any of them “true” or “false.” The following are statements: “She suggested we should get a new refrigerator,” and “He said, 'Stand back!'”
Although there is a difference between a declarative sentence used to make a statement and the statement made with that declarative sentence, this book will often not honor that fine distinction and will speak of declarative sentences themselves as being statements.

You can’t spot the claims if you don’t speak the language. In the passage below from a famous Valley girl, try to decide whether the phrase in italics is (used to make) a claim. You won't be able to figure this out if you don’t understand a little Valley-girl-ese.
So, I loan Whitney my copy of GQ, right, and she drops strawberry yogurt right on the cover, and like I could totally be so edged, but I tried to be cool.
To tell whether it's expressing a claim, you don't have to be able to figure out whether it's true, but only whether it could be─whether it's the sort of thing that might be true or might be false. The passage does make the claim. Its claim is that the speaker could be upset by Whitney's dropping strawberry yogurt on her copy of GQ Magazine.
In spotting statements or claims, you need to pay close attention to language. One of the following is a claim and the other is not. Which is which?
I promised to give you $5. I promise to give you $5.
25
  Answer: The question itself is not a statement, but the larger sentence containing the
9
question is. The larger sentence is used to make a statement about the question.

26

What is an Argument?
The word argument has more than one meaning. In this book we will not use the word in the sense of being unpleasantly argumentative. Instead, it will mean at least one conclusion supported by one or more reasons, all of which are statements.
It takes only one person to have our kind of argument, not two. Saying that two people are "in an argument" means that there are two arguments, not one, in our sense of “argument.” Each of the two persons has his or her own argument. In short, our word argument is a technical term with a more precise meaning than it has in ordinary conversation.
Statements that serve as reasons in an argument are also called premises. Nothing to do with the yard sign that says, “Keep off the premises.” Any argument must have one or more premises. And it will have one or more "inference steps" taking you from the premises to the conclusion. The simplest arguments have just one step. Here is an example of a very simple argument that takes you to the conclusion in just one inference step from two premises:
If it's raining, we should take the umbrella. It is raining.
So, we should take the umbrella.

3. Vote Republican in the next election because doing so will solve almost all the world's problems.
4. John Adams was the second president of the United States. My history teacher said so, and I looked it up on Wikipedia with my phone.

27

To find out whether an argument is present, you need to use your detective skills. Ask yourself whether the speaker gave any reason for saying what was said. If you get a satisfactory answer to your own question, then you probably have detected an argument, and you’ve uncovered its conclusion and premises. In detecting an argument, your main goal is to locate the conclusion, then the reasons given for that conclusion, while mentally deleting all the other sentences and phrases that are not part of the argument.
For any conclusion, the premises used directly to support it are called its basic premises. In a more complicated argument, there may be reasons for the reasons, and so on. But these reasons for the reasons are not part of the core. The core of the argument is the conclusion plus its basic premises.
Every argument has to start somewhere, so it is not a good criticism of an argument to complain that all its premises have not been argued for.

What is the Issue?
We argue in order to settle issues. Issues arise when there is uncertainty about whether to accept or reject a claim, or about what to do or not do. For example, someone argues for the claim that you ought to quit eating strawberry yogurt because it causes cancer, and you wonder whether it really does cause cancer. You are wondering about the following issue:
whether eating strawberry yogurt causes cancer.
It's common to express an issue by using the word "whether" to indicate the uncertainty involved. You don’t want to express the issue by taking just one side of the issue.
When two people are "in an argument," they are divided on the issue. The metaphor is that they are on opposite sides of the fence.
A second, common way of expressing an issue is to present it as a question:


30

Will eating strawberry yogurt cause cancer?
The question also brings out the uncertainty and doesn't take a side. It would be a mistake to say the issue is that eating strawberry yogurt causes cancer. That way of present the issue destroys the uncertainty and presents only one side of the issue.
The issue is not the same as the topic. The topic is food and health. Topics are more general than issues; issues are more specific than topics. When you find an argument, the issue is whether the argument’s conclusion is correct.
────CONCEPT CHECK────
The following sentence shows that the writer is confused about the difference between an issue and a claim:
The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a claim open to refutation.
What is the best way to rewrite the sentence in order to remove the confusion?
a. The claim of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is an issue open to refutation.
b. The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a refuted claim.
c. The claim that an oppressive government is better than no government is controversial and open to refutation.
d. The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a position open to refutation.
────12


31

Our example above used the slippery term “refutation.” If you claim what somebody just said is false, then you aren't refuting their claim; you are simply disagreeing with it. In order to refute it, you'd have to make a successful case that what they said is false. You can’t refute someone’s claim merely by contradicting it.

b. Whether the institution of slavery changed.
c. That institutions can be changed.
d. That institutions can't be changed.
────13
The notion of an issue is explored more deeply in a later chapter.
What is a Proof?
People often argue in order to prove something. But that word “proof” is a tricky word. There are different standards of proof in different situations. You have to meet a higher standard if you are proving a new theorem in mathematics than if you are proving to your neighbor that you saw the same film he did last week. Basically, though, a proof is a convincing argument, an argument that should convince your audience, not simply an argument that does convince them.

Suppose you cannot locate that favorite blue shirt you want to wear. You’ve looked in the closet where you usually keep your shirts. You remember washing it at the Laundromat in your apartment building last week. Maybe you hung it back in the closet after that, or maybe you didn’t. You can’t remember. You don’t remember any other time it has been out of the apartment recently. Could you be having a memory problem? You do remember your worst case of bad memory; last year you were sure your apartment key was on the kitchen table, but then you found it an hour later on a shelf in your refrigerator. But after thinking about this you decide that is very unlikely the shirt loss is because of memory failure. You decide to do a more careful search. You look through each item of clothing in your closet, on the closet floor, and in the drawers in your dresser where you place other clothes. You look a few more places in your apartment. Then you remember that occasionally you hang clothes in the closet on top of other clothes hanging there because you don’t have enough coat hangers. So, you search your closet one more time looking under everything hanging there. Still no shirt. So you conclude, “This proves the shirt was stolen.” You start thinking about your three friends who have been in your apartment since the last time you saw that blue shirt. David was there when you went out for an hour to get party supplies. The shirt would fit him. That proves the shirt was stolen.
A logical reasoner hearing this story might say, “That’s not really a proof,” and this judgment would be correct. What else would it take for you to have a real proof the shirt was stolen by David?

Indicators
Spotting an argument and evaluating whether the argument is any good are two distinct abilities. Usually you use them both at the same time. Before you can evaluate an argument, you have to identify it, so let’s begin with this skill. When you are reading a passage, ask yourself, "Is the writer intending to prove something? Am I being given any reasons intended to convince me to believe something or do something?" Detecting arguments can be difficult

sometimes, but there are verbal clues to look for. The start of a conclusion is often indicated by the word therefore, so, or thus. In addition to these conclusion indicators, the terms because and suppose-that signal that a reason is coming. Since the technical term for reasons is premises, the terms because and suppose-that are called premise indicators. The logical reasoner is always on the alert for premise indicators and conclusion indicators.
Often, however, arguers are not so helpful, and we readers and listeners have to recognize an argument without the help of any indicator terms. And even when we have indicator terms, we can’t rely on them 100%. Those same terms might have other uses. For example, do you see why the conclusion indicator "so" is not working as a conclusion indicator in the following?
Air contains molecules. Dirt does, too. So does water.
There is no argument here, just a sequence of claims. The word “so” is indicating another term in the sequence. It is working as the word “and” usually works, not as a conclusion indicator of an argument.
Premise indicators are verbal clues that you are being given a reason or premise. Then ask yourself, "What are the reasons for the conclusion?" or "How is this point being supported?" Your answers supply the premises. There are verbal clues for finding premises, too. The words "since" and "because" are the most common premise indicator terms, but there are many others.

When looking for an argument within a passage, you need to be alert that sometimes the conclusion is stated before the premises, sometimes after the premises, and sometimes embedded in the middle of the premises. Often, sentences are included that are neither premises nor conclusions; they are there for elaboration or for some other purpose, such as to entertain, to describe, to explain, to discount a possible complaint, and so forth.
Here is an example of an argument from authority that contains both kinds of indicator phrases:
Because the encyclopedia says that the whale shark is the biggest fish in the ocean, it follows that the whale shark really is the biggest fish on Earth.
The word Because indicates a premise, and the phrase it follows that indicates the conclusion. Indicators come before what they indicate. After identifying this argument, you might go on to evaluate it as being fairly strong, but as leaving out the crucial information about whether there are freshwater fish bigger than any fish in the ocean. Can you think of one? There aren’t any.
Here are lists of some more indicator phrases:
