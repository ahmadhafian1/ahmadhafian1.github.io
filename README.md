Every argument contains at least one intended conclusion plus one or more supporting reasons, called premises. However, in some passages it is not easy to tell whether an argument occurs at all, nor what the premises and conclusion of an argument really are, nor how other arguments in the passage are related to that argument. This chapter explores that understatement. It begins with an introduction of special phrases that often indicate the presence of premises and conclusions. Then the chapter investigates the problems of identifying the unstated premises and conclusions. For especially complex argumentation, the chapter introduces a diagramming technique that can provide a helpful display of the argument structure.
What is a Statement?
Statements are what is said. More accurate, statements are things that are said that are either true or false. They are also called claims. Here is one: "The homicide rate in England was fifty times higher in the fourteenth century than it is today." Here is another: “Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system.” Both of these statements happen to be true. A statement that is especially important to us might be called a proposition, assertion, judgment, hypothesis, principle, thesis, or, in some situations, a law. Statements have to be capable of being true or false even if we don't know which. So, if you say, “Is it midnight?” then you've not made a statement. Suggestions, commands, and proposals aren’t statements either. The suggestion “We should get a new refrigerator,” and the command, “Stand back!” and the proposal, “Let’s quit studying,” are not statements. It would be very odd to call any of them “true” or “false.” The following are statements: “She suggested we should get a new refrigerator,” and “He said, 'Stand back!'”
Although there is a difference between a declarative sentence used to make a statement and the statement made with that declarative sentence, this book will often not honor that fine distinction and will speak of declarative sentences themselves as being statements.

You can’t spot the claims if you don’t speak the language. In the passage below from a famous Valley girl, try to decide whether the phrase in italics is (used to make) a claim. You won't be able to figure this out if you don’t understand a little Valley-girl-ese.
So, I loan Whitney my copy of GQ, right, and she drops strawberry yogurt right on the cover, and like I could totally be so edged, but I tried to be cool.
To tell whether it's expressing a claim, you don't have to be able to figure out whether it's true, but only whether it could be─whether it's the sort of thing that might be true or might be false. The passage does make the claim. Its claim is that the speaker could be upset by Whitney's dropping strawberry yogurt on her copy of GQ Magazine.
In spotting statements or claims, you need to pay close attention to language. One of the following is a claim and the other is not. Which is which?
I promised to give you $5. I promise to give you $5.

  Answer: The question itself is not a statement, but the larger sentence containing the

question is. The larger sentence is used to make a statement about the question.

What is an Argument?
The word argument has more than one meaning. In this book we will not use the word in the sense of being unpleasantly argumentative. Instead, it will mean at least one conclusion supported by one or more reasons, all of which are statements.
It takes only one person to have our kind of argument, not two. Saying that two people are "in an argument" means that there are two arguments, not one, in our sense of “argument.” Each of the two persons has his or her own argument. In short, our word argument is a technical term with a more precise meaning than it has in ordinary conversation.
Statements that serve as reasons in an argument are also called premises. Nothing to do with the yard sign that says, “Keep off the premises.” Any argument must have one or more premises. And it will have one or more "inference steps" taking you from the premises to the conclusion. The simplest arguments have just one step. Here is an example of a very simple argument that takes you to the conclusion in just one inference step from two premises:
If it's raining, we should take the umbrella. It is raining.
So, we should take the umbrella.

a. Only a claim, with no reasons given to back it up.
b. An argument using bad reasons.
c. An argument using good reasons (assuming that the arguer is being truthful).
d. None of the above.
1. What time does the movie start?
2. This card can save you a lot of money.
3. Vote Republican in the next election because doing so will solve almost all the world's problems.
4. John Adams was the second president of the United States. My history teacher said so, and I looked it up on Wikipedia with my phone.

27

To find out whether an argument is present, you need to use your detective skills. Ask yourself whether the speaker gave any reason for saying what was said. If you get a satisfactory answer to your own question, then you probably have detected an argument, and you’ve uncovered its conclusion and premises. In detecting an argument, your main goal is to locate the conclusion, then the reasons given for that conclusion, while mentally deleting all the other sentences and phrases that are not part of the argument.
For any conclusion, the premises used directly to support it are called its basic premises. In a more complicated argument, there may be reasons for the reasons, and so on. But these reasons for the reasons are not part of the core. The core of the argument is the conclusion plus its basic premises.
Every argument has to start somewhere, so it is not a good criticism of an argument to complain that all its premises have not been argued for.

Select the one best choice for the conclusion of Sanderson's argument in the following disagreement.
Sanderson: Do you realize just what sort of news you get on a half-hour American TV news program?
Harris: Yes, newsy news. What do you mean?
Sanderson: Brief news, that's what.
Harris: Brief news like boxer shorts?
Sanderson: Ha! Look at a time breakdown of the average half-hour news program broadcast on American TV. It is nine minutes of news!
Harris: What's the rest?

28

Sanderson: Eleven minutes of commercials, six of sports, and four of weather. You can't do much in nine minutes. I say nine is not enough if you are going to call it the "news." What do you think?
Harris: It is enough for me. News can be boring. Besides, if the American public didn't like it, they wouldn't watch it.
Sanderson: Now that's an interesting but ridiculous comment. But I’ve got to go now; we can talk again later.
Sanderson’s conclusion is
a. If the American public didn't like brief TV news, they wouldn't watch it.
b. Do you realize just what sort of news you get in a half-hour American TV news program?
c. That's an interesting but ridiculous comment [about the American public's taste]. d. There is not enough news on a thirty-minute TV news program in America.
e. An average half-hour American TV news program is eleven minutes of commercials, nine of news, six of sports, and four of weather.
After choosing Sanderson's conclusion from the above list, comment on the quality of his argument for that conclusion.

What is the Issue?
We argue in order to settle issues. Issues arise when there is uncertainty about whether to accept or reject a claim, or about what to do or not do. For example, someone argues for the claim that you ought to quit eating strawberry yogurt because it causes cancer, and you wonder whether it really does cause cancer. You are wondering about the following issue:
whether eating strawberry yogurt causes cancer.
It's common to express an issue by using the word "whether" to indicate the uncertainty involved. You don’t want to express the issue by taking just one side of the issue.
When two people are "in an argument," they are divided on the issue. The metaphor is that they are on opposite sides of the fence.
A second, common way of expressing an issue is to present it as a question:


30

Will eating strawberry yogurt cause cancer?
The question also brings out the uncertainty and doesn't take a side. It would be a mistake to say the issue is that eating strawberry yogurt causes cancer. That way of present the issue destroys the uncertainty and presents only one side of the issue.
The issue is not the same as the topic. The topic is food and health. Topics are more general than issues; issues are more specific than topics. When you find an argument, the issue is whether the argument’s conclusion is correct.
────CONCEPT CHECK────
The following sentence shows that the writer is confused about the difference between an issue and a claim:
The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a claim open to refutation.
What is the best way to rewrite the sentence in order to remove the confusion?
a. The claim of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is an issue open to refutation.
b. The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a refuted claim.
c. The claim that an oppressive government is better than no government is controversial and open to refutation.
d. The issue of whether an oppressive government is better than no government is a position open to refutation.
────12


31

Our example above used the slippery term “refutation.” If you claim what somebody just said is false, then you aren't refuting their claim; you are simply disagreeing with it. In order to refute it, you'd have to make a successful case that what they said is false. You can’t refute someone’s claim merely by contradicting it.

What is the issue in this argument?
You politicos keep arguing that institutions can't be changed when, in fact, they change all the time. Haven't they ever heard of the institution of slavery? It’s gone from this continent, isn’t it?
a. Can institutions be changed?
b. Whether the institution of slavery changed.
c. That institutions can be changed.
d. That institutions can't be changed.
────13
The notion of an issue is explored more deeply in a later chapter.
What is a Proof?
People often argue in order to prove something. But that word “proof” is a tricky word. There are different standards of proof in different situations. You have to meet a higher standard if you are proving a new theorem in mathematics than if you are proving to your neighbor that you saw the same film he did last week. Basically, though, a proof is a convincing argument, an argument that should convince your audience, not simply an argument that does convince them.

Suppose you cannot locate that favorite blue shirt you want to wear. You’ve looked in the closet where you usually keep your shirts. You remember washing it at the Laundromat in your apartment building last week. Maybe you hung it back in the closet after that, or maybe you didn’t. You can’t remember. You don’t remember any other time it has been out of the apartment recently. Could you be having a memory problem? You do remember your worst case of bad memory; last year you were sure your apartment key was on the kitchen table, but then you found it an hour later on a shelf in your refrigerator. But after thinking about this you decide that is very unlikely the shirt loss is because of memory failure. You decide to do a more careful search. You look through each item of clothing in your closet, on the closet floor, and in the drawers in your dresser where you place other clothes. You look a few more places in your apartment. Then you remember that occasionally you hang clothes in the closet on top of other clothes hanging there because you don’t have enough coat hangers. So, you search your closet one more time looking under everything hanging there. Still no shirt. So you conclude, “This proves the shirt was stolen.” You start thinking about your three friends who have been in your apartment since the last time you saw that blue shirt. David was there when you went out for an hour to get party supplies. The shirt would fit him. That proves the shirt was stolen.
A logical reasoner hearing this story might say, “That’s not really a proof,” and this judgment would be correct. What else would it take for you to have a real proof the shirt was stolen by David?

Indicators
Spotting an argument and evaluating whether the argument is any good are two distinct abilities. Usually you use them both at the same time. Before you can evaluate an argument, you have to identify it, so let’s begin with this skill. When you are reading a passage, ask yourself, "Is the writer intending to prove something? Am I being given any reasons intended to convince me to believe something or do something?" Detecting arguments can be difficult


33

sometimes, but there are verbal clues to look for. The start of a conclusion is often indicated by the word therefore, so, or thus. In addition to these conclusion indicators, the terms because and suppose-that signal that a reason is coming. Since the technical term for reasons is premises, the terms because and suppose-that are called premise indicators. The logical reasoner is always on the alert for premise indicators and conclusion indicators.
Often, however, arguers are not so helpful, and we readers and listeners have to recognize an argument without the help of any indicator terms. And even when we have indicator terms, we can’t rely on them 100%. Those same terms might have other uses. For example, do you see why the conclusion indicator "so" is not working as a conclusion indicator in the following?
Air contains molecules. Dirt does, too. So does water.
There is no argument here, just a sequence of claims. The word “so” is indicating another term in the sequence. It is working as the word “and” usually works, not as a conclusion indicator of an argument.
Premise indicators are verbal clues that you are being given a reason or premise. Then ask yourself, "What are the reasons for the conclusion?" or "How is this point being supported?" Your answers supply the premises. There are verbal clues for finding premises, too. The words "since" and "because" are the most common premise indicator terms, but there are many others.
────CONCEPT CHECK────
Does this sentence by Albert Einstein contain a conclusion indicator word that is actually working to indicate a conclusion?
The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thing, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.
a. yes b. no ────15


34

Do all strong arguments have two or more premises plus at least one conclusion? a. yes b. no
────16
When looking for an argument within a passage, you need to be alert that sometimes the conclusion is stated before the premises, sometimes after the premises, and sometimes embedded in the middle of the premises. Often, sentences are included that are neither premises nor conclusions; they are there for elaboration or for some other purpose, such as to entertain, to describe, to explain, to discount a possible complaint, and so forth.
Here is an example of an argument from authority that contains both kinds of indicator phrases:
Because the encyclopedia says that the whale shark is the biggest fish in the ocean, it follows that the whale shark really is the biggest fish on Earth.
The word Because indicates a premise, and the phrase it follows that indicates the conclusion. Indicators come before what they indicate. After identifying this argument, you might go on to evaluate it as being fairly strong, but as leaving out the crucial information about whether there are freshwater fish bigger than any fish in the ocean. Can you think of one? There aren’t any.
Here are lists of some more indicator phrases:
