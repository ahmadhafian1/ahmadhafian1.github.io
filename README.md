Every argument contains at least one intended conclusion plus one or more supporting reasons, called premises. However, in some passages it is not easy to tell whether an argument occurs at all, nor what the premises and conclusion of an argument really are, nor how other arguments in the passage are related to that argument. This chapter explores that understatement. It begins with an introduction of special phrases that often indicate the presence of premises and conclusions. Then the chapter investigates the problems of identifying the unstated premises and conclusions. For especially complex argumentation, the chapter introduces a diagramming technique that can provide a helpful display of the argument structure.
What is a Statement?
Statements are what is said. More accurate, statements are things that are said that are either true or false. They are also called claims. Here is one: "The homicide rate in England was fifty times higher in the fourteenth century than it is today." Here is another: “Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system.” Both of these statements happen to be true. A statement that is especially important to us might be called a proposition, assertion, judgment, hypothesis, principle, thesis, or, in some situations, a law. Statements have to be capable of being true or false even if we don't know which. So, if you say, “Is it midnight?” then you've not made a statement. Suggestions, commands, and proposals aren’t statements either. The suggestion “We should get a new refrigerator,” and the command, “Stand back!” and the proposal, “Let’s quit studying,” are not statements. It would be very odd to call any of them “true” or “false.” The following are statements: “She suggested we should get a new refrigerator,” and “He said, 'Stand back!'”
Although there is a difference between a declarative sentence used to make a statement and the statement made with that declarative sentence, this book will often not honor that fine distinction and will speak of declarative sentences themselves as being statements.
